metr-la.h5: The raw METR-LA traffic dataset, stored in HDF5 format for efficient I/O and large-scale data handling.
METR_LA_adj.pkl: Pickle file containing the adjacency matrix of the METR-LA sensor network.
graph-sensor-locations.csv: Geographical coordinates of sensor nodes. Each row typically includes: node ID, longitude, and latitude.
graph-sensor-ids.txt: Plain text file listing all sensor node IDs (one per line), used for indexing or mapping.
distance-la-2012.csv: Pairwise distances between sensor nodes .
data.npz: Preprocessed dataset generated by main_METR_LA.py, containing train/validation/test splits under multiple missing rates (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%) for robustness evaluation.


** Both data.npz and METR_LA_adj.pkl are generated by running the corresponding utility scripts.**
