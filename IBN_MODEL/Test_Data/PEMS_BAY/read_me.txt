pems-bay.h5: The PEMS-BAY dataset, stored in HDF5 format for efficient I/O operations.
PEMS_BAY_adj.pkl: Pickle file storing the adjacency matrix of the PEMS-BAY sensor network.
graph-sensor-locations-bay.csv: Geographical location information of sensor nodes. Each row typically contains: node ID, longitude, and latitude.
distance-bay-2017.csv: Pairwise distance matrix between sensor nodes in the PEMS-BAY dataset (recorded in 2017).
data.npz: Preprocessed data from main_PEMS_BAY.py, saved in compressed NumPy format.
          Due to GPU memory constraints, it contains train/validation/test splits under a specific missing rate (e.g., 25%).

** Both data.npz and PEMS_BAY_adj.pkl are generated by running the corresponding utility scripts.**
