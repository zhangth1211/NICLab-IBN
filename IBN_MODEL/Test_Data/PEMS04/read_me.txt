pems04.npz: The raw PEMS04 traffic dataset, stored in compressed NumPy .npz format for efficient loading and storage.
PEMS04_adj.pkl: Pickle file containing the prior (static) adjacency matrix of the PEMS04 sensor network.
distance.csv: Pairwise distances between sensor nodes. Used to construct or augment the prior adjacency matrix (e.g., via distance-based thresholding or Gaussian kernel).
data.npz: Preprocessed dataset generated from PEMS04, containing train/validation/test splits under multiple missing rates (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%) for flexible experimentation.


** Both data.npz and PEMS04_adj.pkl are generated by running the corresponding utility scripts.**
